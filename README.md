# splatdotfiles

vaguely splatoonish dotfiles for hyprland and other software. first (*second) attempt at a rice.

## software this configures

- hyprland
- hyprpaper
- hyprlock
- waybar
- rofi
- kitty (barely, just makes it semitransparent)

## usage

- install BlitzBold and BlitzMain [from here](https://github.com/North-West-Wind/splatoon3-fonts)
  - for me they were called 'Splatoon1' and 'Splatoon2' but i might not have gotten them from here
- replace the references to the wallpaper image with wherever you want to put it, or some other file
- copy folders into your config directory (make backups and whatnot)
